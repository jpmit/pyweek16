HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

[See the in game instructions for a quick start]

Your arch nemesis (the guy at the top of the screen!) has traveled round 
the galaxies of the Universe, distorting their information fields.

Your job is to realign the information fields before he is able to destroy 
all of the information in the universe!  You can do this by clicking on the 
center of the portals with the mouse, which will cause them to rotate.  
When there is a path between the top left and botom right portal, the level 
is complete.

Each galaxy (5 in total) consists of 10 levels, all of which need to be 
realigned before the time runs out.

If you can't get enough, try visiting the bonus galaxy which consists of 
10 random levels (different each time).
